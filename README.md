This is my second project as part of the Yandex100 program. 

#### The repository includes: 
1. Project code- ipynb 
2. Project HTML

#### Project description: 
The assignment is to learn how to determine the market value of real estate properties and to define the parameters. 
The research will make it possible to build an automated system capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.

This is data from a real estate agency with an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years.

There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is a userâ€™s input. The second type is received automatically based upon the map data, for example, the distance from the city center, airport, the nearest park, or body of water.

The project includes processing missing values, calculatinons and categorizing data, and exploratory data analysis (using matplotlib and seaborn).
